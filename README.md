## Task Management

### Covey quadrant used for smaller tasks - hence why doesnt connect to tak list which for bigger projects

### Task list doesn't pop out, easier to scroll, rather than go to another pop-out page

## Time Management

### Felt pomodoro tracker at the bottom was too distracting

## Content Management

### Add logo to bottom left corner in order to give a sense of consistency in the website
